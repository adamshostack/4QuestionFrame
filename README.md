# Shostack's 4 Question Frame for Threat Modeling 


1. **What are we working on?**
2. **What can go wrong?**
3. **What are we going to do about it?**
4. **Did we do a good job?**

These questions are designed to help people build better systems. They work less well for end-users of technology.

The authoritative reference is page 4, *Threat Modeling: Designing for Security*.  The form which appears there is different. The changes include:
* We has replaced you, to be inclusive and collaborative
* "are" has replaced "should" in question 3, to be more focused on action
* Simplified the wording.
* I'll regularly ask "did we do a good enough job?" The goal is not to do a good job at threat modeling, but to drive improvement to a system.
