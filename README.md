# Shostack's 4 Question Frame for Threat Modeling 


1. **What are we working on?**
2. **What can go wrong?**
3. **What are we going to do about it?**
4. **Did we do a good job?**

These questions are designed to help people build better systems. They work less well for end-users of technology.

The authoritative reference is page 4, *Threat Modeling: Designing for Security*.  I've evolved the questions since then. The changes include:
* We has replaced you, to be inclusive and collaborative
* "are" has replaced "should" in question 3, to be more focused on action
* Simplified the wording.
* I'll regularly ask "did we do a good enough job?" The goal is not to do a good job at threat modeling, but to drive improvement to a system.

## Nuances
People will sometimes phrase the first question "what are we _building_" rather than _working on_. The "building" frame draws people towards a waterfall approach with the attendant problems.

In the Threat Modeling Manifesto, the team had a preference for adding the word "enough" to the 4th question: did we do a good *enough* job? I appreciate the lessened pressure, and miss the aspiration, and so keep the terse form here.

There's a [60 second video](https://youtu.be/Yt0PhyEdZXU) that introduces the questions. There's a 2024 whitepaper, "Understanding the Four Question Framework for Threat Modeling" at [shostack.org/whitepapers/](https://shostack.org/whitepapers/)

### Legalese, citations.

I'm told some lawyers have been concerned about quoting a complete thing, and asserted that it pushes at the limits of fair use to use all 23 of these words as a unit.
